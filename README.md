This repository is for UBC's Biomedical Engineering Student Team use only.

The design challenge for this year's workshop is using an Arduino to perform different room regulation functionalities for a client with a mobility disability. Students will use an Arduino Uno with a servo motor, photoresistor, RGB LED, and DHT 22 sensor. The goal for the workshop is for students to figure out design specifications, wire the circuit, and write the Arduino code. The code uploaded is an example of what I have done which can be used for reference. Students should work in pairs and try to write their own code without looking at the example at first.

The skeleton files are to be used by mentees to practice skills and questions in C for their coding workshop.
Solutions I made for each of the questions are in the respectively named folders.
