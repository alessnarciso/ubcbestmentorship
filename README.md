Solutions and exercises for UBC BEST 2018/2019 Mentorship Program in C. 

This repository is for UBC's Biomedical Engineering Student Team use only.
The skeleton files are to be used by mentees to practice skills and questions in C for their coding workshop.
Solutions I made for each of the questions are in the respectively named folders.
